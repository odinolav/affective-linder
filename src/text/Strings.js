  background: `My senior project will examine student perceptions of stress. In this study, we would like to find out how the higher
    education experience affects students’ perception of stress. We want to find out what counts as “stressful” for American college
    students by considering their subjective experience. This activity is known as a Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) which provides
    more continuous information and is more narrative and story like qualitative information than a plan survey. By doing this activity, I
    am hoping to gain a better understanding of how sorts of activities are associated with stress.
    Your privacy is important to me and your personal information will not be attached to your responses. By filling out this sheet and participating
    in the activity, you are consenting to participate in the study and agree that the purpose of this research has been satisfactorily
    explained to you.`,
  instructions: `I am asking you to track your daily activities and associated stress level. This should be done twice a week for three
    weeks, for a total of six different days (unless otherwise specified by me). This form will be your guide. Please fill out each box,
    preferably adding to it as the day progresses to keep responses more authentic and accurate. For each part of the day, fill out the
    three categories to the best of your ability, being as thorough as you are able. Describe anything significant that happened
    in that time frame (classes, meetings, interactions, etc.) and how you felt about it. Did it make you happy, excited, tired, stressed,
    overwhelmed, etc? Please feel free to add whatever comes to your mind. The more the merrier. I have also provided a section for a
    reflection on the entire day. Think back on your day and whether it was good, bad, stressful, normal, exciting, etc.`,
  disclaimer: `At no time are you required to write about or answer anything that you don’t feel comfortable with. Luther College has as standing
    committee, the HSRB, to which complaints or problems concerning any research project may be reported to The Dean’s Office,
    Luther College, 563-387-1005 if they arise.`,
